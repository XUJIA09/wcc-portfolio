            <h1>Xu Jia</h1>
            <p>Hello there! I am an artist specializing in creative computing. I am currently studying at Goldsmiths, where I have honed my skills in using coding and interactive installations to explore social issues. My work is about engaging viewers and challenging them to think deeply about the world around them.</p>
                <p>My creative process is deeply rooted in a desire to explore the intersection between art and technology. I firmly believe that technology can be harnessed to create truly innovative and impactful works of art, and I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</p>
